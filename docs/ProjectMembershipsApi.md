### Example

* Bearer Authentication (personalAccessToken):

```python
import asana_preview
from asana_preview.api import project_memberships_api
from pprint import pprint

# Configure Bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
configuration = asana_preview.Configuration(
    access_token = 'PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN'
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with asana_preview.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = project_memberships_api.ProjectMembershipsApi(api_client)
    project_membership_gid = "1331" # str | 
    opt_pretty = True # bool | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)
    opt_fields = ["member","write_access","user","project"] # [str] | This endpoint returns a compact resource, which excludes some properties by default. To include those optional properties, set this query parameter to a comma-separated list of the properties you wish to include. (optional)

    # Example passing only required values which don't have defaults set

        # Get a project membership
        api_response = api_instance.get_project_membership(project_membership_gid)

| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|

**403** | The authentication and request syntax was valid but the server is refusing to complete the request. This can happen if you try to read or write to objects or properties that the user does not have access to. |  -  |
