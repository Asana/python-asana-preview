# ProjectMembershipCompactAllOf

With the introduction of “comment-only” projects in Asana, a user’s membership in a project comes with associated permissions. These permissions (whether a user has full access to the project or comment-only access) are accessible through the project memberships endpoints described here.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**user** | [**UserCompact**](UserCompact.md) |  | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
