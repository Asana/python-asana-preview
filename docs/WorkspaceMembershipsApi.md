```python
import asana_preview
from asana_preview.api import workspace_memberships_api
from pprint import pprint

# Configure Bearer authorization: personalAccessToken
configuration = asana_preview.Configuration(
    access_token = 'PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN'
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with asana_preview.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = workspace_memberships_api.WorkspaceMembershipsApi(api_client)
    workspace_membership_gid = "12345" # str | 
    opt_pretty = True # bool | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)
